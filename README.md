Building a UI (website) for farmers to upload images of crops. Develop a deep learning model to identify diseases in crops. In this project we have chosen the crop to be potato.
However, we can apply the same model to a variety of crops like tomatoes, peas etc.

Technologies used:
Python, FastApi for backend, React for frontend, TensorFlow for deep learning.

Our project consists of the following:
1. Dataset includes three classes of potatoes namely, Early blight, Healthy and Late blight.
2. A model designed using tensorflow.
3. The trained model is saved in a folder.
4. FastApi is used to design the backend of our UI.
5. The frontend is made using REACT.
6. Output images of the final website and the output images of our classification.

Steps to run the project:
1. First, connect the backend server designed using FastApi. You can also check the backend by sending POST request from Postman.
2. Then run the command, "npm start" in the console to start the website.
3. The website will show up in your running browser. You can now test it for potato leaves.
